# UWW - MAGD Portfolio

### MAGD 150 Final - Coloring Page
This project functioned as the final exam for MAGD150 - Intro to MAGD. For this project, I created a simple coloring page application using P5.js. Clicking the left mouse button down places color, and while holding down that button, the numbers 1-0 across the keyboard can be pressed to change brush size and color. Note: It is REQUIRED to run the folder and index.html file in a live server due to Chrome's restrictions with file uploads.
